# Step 2: Acquire and display live video
We will in this part use OpenCV to capture and display live video from your camera.

## 1. Write the code
Write the following code in `main.cpp`.
(Yes, it is intentional that you cannot copy it directly...)

![C++ code](img/code.png)

## 2. Compile and run the code
You can build the project by pressing `Ctrl + F9`.
You can run/debug the code by pressing `Shift + F10/F9`.

You should now see live video streaming from your camera!

## 3. Reflect
Read the code.
What does it do?
Please ask the instructors if you have questions!
You should also take a look at our [introduction to C++ and OpenCV](resources/TEK5030-Compendium.pdf).

When you get the code to run, and are finished playing around with it, contine to the [last step](3-processing-live-video.md).
