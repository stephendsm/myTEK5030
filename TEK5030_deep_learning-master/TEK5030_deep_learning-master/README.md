# TEK5030_deep_learning
This week we have 3 exercises. They each have a [python notebook](https://jupyter.org/), which is a set of instructions and code you can run. They are ment to be run in [colab](http://colab.research.google.com). There you have access to a powerfull GPU, and you don't need any additional setup. You do need Google account to run the notebooks in colab.

(not recommended) Alternatively you could use https://www.kaggle.com/notebooks to run the notebooks, or you can [install and run jupyter notebook](https://medium.com/codingthesmartway-com-blog/getting-started-with-jupyter-notebook-for-python-4e7082bd5d46) on your own machine.

## Enable GPU in colab
For the best experience you'll need to enable GPUs for the notebook:

- Navigate to Editâ†’Notebook Settings
- select GPU from the Hardware Accelerator drop-down

*I also recommend to click "Copy in drive" to run the code in your own Google Drive*

## Learn more about Tensorflow
On [tensorflow.org/tutorials](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials) can you find lots of learning material and good tutorials.

If you find our exercises hard, it could be a good idea to check out one of the tensorflow tutorials, as they are much more in depth.
